## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r echo=FALSE}
      # add hyperlinks in the format of Rmd
      full_data$link <- paste0("[", full_data$title, "](", full_data$link, ")")
      knitr::kable(full_data)
```
